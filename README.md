# DFaP: Data Filtering and Purification Against Backdoor Attacks
## Intro
This is a demo that shows the usage scenarios and effects of DFaP. 

In [DFaP.ipynb](https://github.com/NGKIYNET/DFaP/blob/main/DFaP.ipynb), we show the implementation of the relevant functions, the parameter settings, backdoor samples filtering and purification effect and dataset filtering and purification effect.

## Datasets
As in the paper we used three publicly available datasets. The data can be accessed through the following linksï¼š
+ CIFAR-10: <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html>
+ GRSRB: <https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html>
